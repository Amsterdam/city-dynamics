- pull from git
- change docker-compose.yml -> app to private folder
- change importer/run_import.sh -> comment out: download from object store.
  This requires the data to be put in the local private/data/ folder manually
- change sources.conf to comment out the unneeded data sources.


Go to terminal on the city-dynamics folder

Run:

(For this step it is needed to be connected to the internal AMS network)
docker-compose build database
docker-compose up database

(For this step it is important not to be connected to the internal AMS network)
docker-compose build importer
docker-compose up database

(now it doesn't matter as long as you have internet)
docker-compose build analyzer
docker-compose up analyzer

OR
cd analyzer
python calc_index.py dev

cd web
source activate citydynamics
python manage.py runserver 8000
